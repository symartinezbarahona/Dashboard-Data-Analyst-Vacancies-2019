## Report For Data Analyst Postings on Glassdoor 2019  
### Selvyn Yovany Martinez Barahona 

In this report, I analyze and display key performance indicators that provide insight into Glassdoor's performance in 2019. The data source was from Picklesueat's repository on Github and Kaggle. Picklesueat collected data about job applications for opportunities posted on Glassdoor. This data contains information about the jobs for which people applied, if they submitted their application for the job opening using the agency's easy-apply process, and whether the applicant was ultimately hired.

The data source you'll use to make the dashboard can be found here [2019_data_analyst_jobs.csv](https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1QX2MyI-heY3hm5XyFcMmOzgvZLSONOQ0&export=download).Click the link to download it onto your computer.
